    "reason": "Creating symbolic links on macOS is not restricted by permissions, but opening the editor through a symlink has proven to be unreliable. To ensure a smooth experience, we provide a dedicated copy of the engine for each project instead. While Godot is only around 200MB (and this is generally not a problem) be aware that multiple projects can lead to increased disk usage.",

You can enable symlinks anytime from <strong>Settings → Behavior → Editor symlinks</strong> when you want lower disk usage.",
    "change1": "Creating symbolic links on Windows requires administrator privileges and elevated command execution. The launcher now elevates permissions only when creating symlinks.",
