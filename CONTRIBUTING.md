## Reporting Bugs

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Before creating a new bug report, please check the [open issues](https://github.com/godotlauncher/launcher/issues) and [closed issues](https://github.com/godotlauncher/launcher/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aclosed) to see if it has already been reported.

Submit bug reports [here](https://github.com/godotlauncher/launcher/issues/new?template=bug_report.md).  
Please follow the template instructions.

- Submit a **separate bug report for each issue** you encounter.  
- Verify that the bug can be reproduced on the latest release. You can find all releases in the [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/godotlauncher/launcher/releases).  
- If this is a **regression** (a bug that did not exist in previous versions), specify the versions where the bug was present and where it was not.

## Proposing Features

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Before creating a new feature request, please check the [open issues](https://github.com/godotlauncher/launcher/issues) and [closed issues](https://github.com/godotlauncher/launcher/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aclosed) to see if it has already been reported.

Submit feature requests [here](https://github.com/godotlauncher/launcher/issues/new?template=feature_request.md).  
Please follow the template instructions.

- **Create one proposal per feature** to keep discussions focused.  
- If a feature feels too large or complex, discuss it first on [Discord](http://discord.gg/Ju9jkFJGvz).

## Contributing Translations

Our interface translations were initially seeded with AI-generated content, so every language benefits from human review. If you spot awkward phrasing or want to add a new locale, we would love your help.

- Start with the detailed [Contributing Translations guide](CONTRIBUTING_TRANSLATIONS.md) for setup, required files, and testing tips.  
- Improvements of existing strings, terminology fixes, and typo corrections are all valuable contributions—no change is too small.  
- When adding a new language, remember to copy all locale namespaces, keep JSON keys intact, and register the language in the selector component as described in the guide.

Once you've verified the UI locally, open a PR so we can review and ship your updates to the community.

## Contributing Pull Requests

Thank you for your interest in contributing! Here are a few things to keep in mind before submitting a pull request (PR):

- **Ensure the change is valuable** – If you’re introducing a new feature, consider whether it solves a common need for users.  
- **Discuss before coding** – For larger changes, open an issue first using the **Feature Request** template so the community can provide input.  
- **Your PR is still useful even if not merged** – Even if a PR isn't accepted, it may help guide future improvements.

For bug fixes, if you're unsure about the best solution, discuss it first on [Discord](https://discord.gg/Ju9jkFJGvz).

## Pull Request Guidelines

### Keep PRs Simple and Focused

- Each PR should address **one issue or feature at a time** to make reviews easier.  
- Avoid bundling multiple fixes or features in a single PR.  
- Link your PR to the relevant issue when applicable (e.g., `Fixes #123`).  

### Code Formatting and Structure

- Follow the existing project structure and conventions.  
- Keep commit history clean—use **squash** and **rebase** to tidy up before submitting.  
- Use meaningful commit messages (see below).  
- Add user-facing text to **all locale files** (`src/locales/<lang>`) so translations stay in sync.  

### Writing Good Commit Messages

A well-structured commit message helps with code history and future debugging. We follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) format so changelog automation stays reliable. Follow these guidelines:

- Start the subject line with a Conventional Commit type such as `feat`, `fix`, `chore`, or `docs`, and add a scope when it clarifies the change (e.g., `feat(installs): ...`).  
- Keep the first line **concise and descriptive** (under 72 characters if possible).  
- Write the summary in **imperative form** (e.g., `fix: handle custom project paths`, `feat: add auto-update toggle`).  
- If needed, provide more details in a second paragraph.  

**Examples of good commit messages:**
```
fix: correct version detection on startup

Previously, the launcher failed to detect custom Godot versions correctly
due to missing path validation. This update adds proper validation and 
fallbacks.
```

```
feat: add quick project access from system tray

Users can now right-click the tray icon to instantly open recent projects.
This improves usability and saves time navigating the project list.
```

### Keeping Your Branch Updated

- Before submitting a PR, update your branch with the latest changes:
  ```bash
  git pull --rebase upstream main
  ```
- This avoids unnecessary merge commits and keeps the history clean.  

---

## Documentation and Comments

- If your PR changes **user-facing functionality**, update the **official documentation** at [Godot Launcher Docs](https://github.com/godotlauncher/launcher-docs).  
- If your PR modifies complex internal logic, add **inline comments** to explain key parts of the code.  

---

## Testing Your Changes

- **Test your modifications** thoroughly to ensure they work as expected before submitting a PR.  
- If applicable, describe how your changes were tested in the **PR description**.  
- **Unit Tests**: If your change affects logic or functionality, include unit tests to verify behavior.  
- **End-to-End (E2E) Tests**: If your change affects user interactions or workflows, consider adding E2E tests to confirm everything works as intended.  
- **Increase Your Chances of a Merge**: PRs that include relevant tests are more likely to be accepted, as they provide confidence that changes won't introduce regressions.
